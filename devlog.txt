Created DB-API wrapper, StoryTellingDatabase, in storytelling_db.py
    with API methods that will be used in the flask app to query the data.
    The namedtuples User, Story, and Edit are used to pass their simple data around.
Created a partial skeleton of routes and functions in app.py
    just to understand how it would interact with the StoryTellingDatabase.
