Created DB-API wrapper, StoryTellingDatabase, in storytelling_db.py
    with API methods that will be used in the flask app to query the data.
    The namedtuples User, Story, and Edit are used to pass their simple data around.
Created a partial skeleton of routes and functions in app.py
    just to understand how it would interact with the StoryTellingDatabase.

senK -- 2017-10-22 03:12:00
Added most of read_or_edit_story and create/add_new_story routes
    and worked on app.py route skeletons.

senK -- 2017-10-22 03:40:30
Added edited_story route to handle submission of story edits/creation.

senK -- 2017-10-22 16:34:01
Added comments for almost all public functions and methods.

ruvinshteynM -- 2017-10-24 13:19:04
Created minimal versions of base.jinja2 and base_logged.jinja2; started minimal version of home.jinja2

senK -- 2017-10-25 14:19:59
Added JS for automatic and simpler form submission in homepage links.  Probably won't be used, but I'm adding it anyways in case since I already wrote it.

senK -- 2017-10-25 14:22:13
Fixed a few bugs and rearranged some flask routes that whose design changed.

senK -- 2017-10-25 15:00:26
Modified read_or_edit_story route to use only storyname from form instead of also requiring story_id, which reflects our changes in home.jinja2.
