### Summary
We are developing a site where users can update, create, and view stories. The catch is that when editing, the user can only see the most recent update, and a user can only view a full story once the user has edited it.


### Dependencies
  * Flask
  * passlib
  * python-dateutil
  * typing
  * virtualenv

### Launch Instructions
 1. Clone this repo using SSH:
 
     `git clone git@github.com:csmithsalzberg/Mr-CSS-Rockets.git`
 
      or HTTPS: 
 
      `git clone https://github.com/csmithsalzberg/Mr-CSS-Rockets.git`
 
 2. For the safety of your computer, run a python virtual environment. It's just the right thing to do.
 
 3. Once you have a virtualenv running, run app.py: 
 
      `python app.py` 
 
       Any dependencies that are missing will be automatically installed!
